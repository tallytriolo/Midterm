        <h1>Why dogs are better than cats?</h1>
        <p> First of all, I'd like to say that I don't hate cats. However my preference has always been for dogs. Dogs are considered a human's best friend. They are companions, they are protector and always they are by your side. They feel if you are happy or sad. 
        Dogs are easy to train and they are polite. They can respond to all your commands, help people with illnesses and people who need accessibility. And that's one of the reasons I think dogs are better than cats.</p>

        <p>I have a dog, his name is Romeu and he is my emotional support. He is very docile, loves affection and always keeps me company. He's definitely my best friend and as you can see, my daughter's best friend too.</p>
