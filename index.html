        <h1>Cats are better pets</h1>
        <p> I prefer cats because they are sweet and independent. Cats don't give you much problem or work. They don't depend on people near them all the time. And they don't need to walk outside because they use their sandbox. This point is fantastic because no one deserves to leave home during the wintertime. Cats are amazing.
            My cat sleeps 8 hours a day. When he is not sleeping, he is eating. He is an old cat and does not want to play for more than 5 minutes. He is an intelligent cat because he can open doors and windows. There are no arguments to discuss how cats are better than dogs....they are.</p>
